## About the small business lending rule

The purposes of the small business lending rule are to facilitate enforcement of fair lending laws and to enable communities, 
governmental entities, and creditors to identify business and community development needs and opportunities of women-owned, 
minority-owned, and small businesses.

The rule specifies several data points that financial institutions are required to collect and report to the CFPB. 
The rule also contains a number of other requirements regarding the information compiled pursuant to the rule, 
including a requirement that covered financial institutions restrict certain persons’ access to certain information, 
requirements regarding maintaining certain information, and requirements regarding the reporting and publication of data.
